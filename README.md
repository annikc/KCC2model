# KCC2model
Ongoing to-do list: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G1RuNlDHYTx5nhs32q0ZfmgSOhofUhxcbc9QnsA9SNg/edit

This folder contains hoc code for both a single compartment model (in ./SCM) and multicompartment moded (./MCM). 
Both models use mod files from ./_mods

Will update with bash scripts for running code on SciNet system, including automatic compiling from ./_mods

# SCM 
Will focus on getting working simulation in SCM first. To run: 
'''
> nrngui SCMpromptWindow.hoc
'''
Will need to update this file to remove unpaired synapses and option to run in different compartments.
